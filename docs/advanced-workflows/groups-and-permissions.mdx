various features of webapp.io. Permissions can be managed for the members of
your organization through the members section of organization settings.

Permissions are a hierarchy of keywords separated by periods(`.`) using
star(`*`) as a wildcard.

#### Examples:

`settings.billing.tier` equates to the organziation billing tier setting
permission.

`settings.*` equates to all organziation settings permissions.

`*` equates to all permissions.

`helloWorld/my first.program` is normalized to `helloWorld/my-first-program`
